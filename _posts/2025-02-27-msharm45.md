Based on the analysis of the CODEX dataset, I'm interpreting the tissue structure represented 
as the white pulp of the spleen. This conclusion is drawn from the identification of two specific 
immune cell types: CD3e (T cells) and CD68 (macrophages), which are prevalent in the white pulp and 
play crucial roles in the adaptive immune response. 

The UMAP visualizations generated from the analysis reveal distinct clusters where both T cells and 
macrophages coexist, indicating areas of active immune engagement characteristic of white pulp. T cells,
marked by CD3e, facilitate immune responses to pathogens, while CD68-positive macrophages are essential 
for phagocytosis and antigen presentation, particularly in the marginal zone and follicles of the white pulp.

The differential expression analysis, visualized through a volcano plot, highlights the significant 
upregulation of genes associated with T cell activation and macrophage responses within the cluster 
of interest. This further supports the interpretation of the tissue as active white pulp.

The data also show a significant amount of downregulation, which provides additional insights 
into the tissue's function. The downregulation of genes associated with other splenic regions—such as 
red pulp macrophages (e.g., F4/80) or endothelial cells—suggests that this cluster does not belong to 
the red pulp or a vascular structure like an artery/vein. Similarly, a lack of stromal or fibroblast-related
gene expression makes capsule/trabecula an unlikely classification. The pattern of downregulated
genes could indicate that the white pulp is undergoing a specific immune response, where certain 
homeostatic or regulatory genes are suppressed in favor of an activated immune state. This would be 
consistent with the role of the white pulp in antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation, supporting 
the idea that the identified structure is not just resting white pulp, but an actively responding immune 
microenvironment.

Together, these findings and analyses strongly suggest that the observed cellular composition within the 
CODEX dataset aligns with the characteristics of white pulp tissue, demonstrating the active immune processes 
typical of this region in the spleen.

I used my code from homework 3/4, class activities, and ChatGPT to help in the DE and UMAP analysis as well as format my graphs.
