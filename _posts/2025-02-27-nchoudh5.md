(A) This panel presents the visualization of cellular clusters in tSNE space, where distinct populations (Cluster 1 in red, Cluster 4 in green) are delineated against a background of unclustered cells (gray).

(B) This panel depicts the spatial organization of these clusters in physical tissue space, demonstrating a structured and non-random localization pattern within the tissue architecture.

(C) The left panel illustrates the results of differential expression analysis for Cluster 1, identifying CD21, HLA-DR, ECAD, and CD20 as significantly upregulated markers, consistent with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and B-cell populations within lymphoid structures.

(D) The right panel presents differential expression analysis for Cluster 4, highlighting significant upregulation of Podoplanin and Ki-67, indicative of proliferating B cells within a germinal center and possibly stromal support cells involved in the structural organization of lymphoid follicles.

(E) The left panel maps CD21 expression in tSNE space, revealing its selective enrichment in Cluster 1, further supporting the identity of this cluster as a B-cell–rich follicular region with follicular dendritic cell involvement.

(F) The right panel visualizes CD21 expression in physical space, confirming its localized distribution within a distinct anatomical region.

(G, H) The final two panels illustrate Ki-67 expression in both tSNE space and physical space, demonstrating its enrichment in Cluster 4 and its localized proliferation within a specific tissue region. This pattern is consistent with germinal center B cells undergoing rapid clonal expansion.

### What Two Distinct Cell Types Are Represented?
The dataset reveals two functionally distinct cell populations:

Cluster 1 differentially upregulates CD21, HLA-DR, and CD20 and is therefore highly 
indicative of a B cell population, as these markers are characteristic of various 
stages of B cell development and activation. CD20 (MS4A1) is a well-established 
marker of mature B cells, including naive and memory B cells, but is absent in 
plasma cells. CD21 (CR2) is expressed on follicular and germinal center B cells, 
playing a crucial role in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and immune complex binding. 
HLA-DR, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule, is upregulated 
in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, facilitating antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. 
The co-expression of these three markers suggests that the cluster represents a mature, 
antigen-experienced B cell population


Cluster 4 differentially upregulates Ki67 (MKI67), Podoplanin (PDPN), and 
E-Cadherin (ECAD/CDH1) is indicative of a highly proliferative epithelial 
cell population. Ki67 marks active cell division, suggesting rapid growth, 
while E-Cadherin is a hallmark of epithelial identity, maintaining cell-cell 
adhesion. Podoplanin, though more commonly associated with mesenchymal and
lymphatic cells, can also be expressed in certain epithelial contexts, 
particularly in proliferating or transitioning epithelial cells.

### Tissue Identity
The presence of a B cell-rich cluster (upregulating CD21, HLA-DR, and CD20) 
strongly suggests that this sample is from the white pulp of the spleen, as the
white pulp is the primary site of B cell localization and activation within the 
spleen. The spleen’s white pulp is organized into B cell follicles and germinal 
centers, where B cells undergo maturation, antigen presentation, and immune 
responses. The identification of a proliferative epithelial population
(upregulating Ki67, Podoplanin, and E-Cadherin) further supports this conclusion, 
as the spleen’s capsule and trabeculae, which contain mesothelial and stromal cells, 
are adjacent to the white pulp and may exhibit epithelial proliferation during 
immune activation or tissue remodeling.
