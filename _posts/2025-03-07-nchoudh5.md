### Write a brief description of your figure so we know what you are visualizing.

In the new analysis, the first panel uses scatterbar to display the deconvolved cell-type proportions for each tissue spot with k=7.Each spot shows a precise breakdown of cell types, with the height of each bar segment representing the fraction contributed by each cell type. The second panel maps the deconvolved expression of GPX3 to the cell type where it is most active, clearly showing the spatial distribution of GPX3. The third panel presents k-means clustering applied to the deconvolved proportions, ensuring that each spot is assigned to one of seven clusters based on its specific cell-type makeup. The accompanying volcano plot quantitatively distinguishes genes that are significantly different between one cluster and all others.

In the previous analysis (HW3) I relied on a t-SNE projection to reduce the high-dimensional gene expression data, where each tissue spot was assigned to a single cluster. This method identified broad spatial patterns and differential gene expression but did not account for overlapping cell-type contributions, as each spot was forced into one distinct group. Consequently, while the t-SNE approach highlighted major differences between clusters, it oversimplified the cellular composition by ignoring the possibility of mixed cell types within a spot.

Comparing the two methods reveals that the deconvolution-based approach provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the tissue’s cellular heterogeneity. The scatterbar visualization explicitly quantifies the exact proportions of multiple cell types in each spot, and the deconvolved GPX3 map pinpoints the regions with high expression of this gene within the specific cell type. In contrast, the t-SNE-based clustering assigns each spot to one group, which can mask the complex mixtures present in the tissue.

These differences also affect the differential expression analysis. The new volcano plot identifies genes that are enriched in a cluster defined by a specific mixture of cell types, offering clear and actionable insights into the biological markers that define that region. This level of detail confirms that the deconvolution approach not only captures the overlapping cellular architecture of the tissue but also improves the identification of key marker genes such as GPX3 when compared to the more coarse grouping of the t-SNE method.
