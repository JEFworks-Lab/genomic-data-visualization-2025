Here I perform clustering and differential expression analysis on a CODEX data set obtained from a spleen sample. Following an identification of the ideal 10 k-means clusters, I visualized the clusters in tSNE dimensionality reduced space and in physical space. Isolating clusters and performing differential analysis, I identified two clusters, 10 and 6, that I found to be particularly interesting for their upregulated expression of CD21 and CD45RO, respectively. For each, I visualize the expression of the gene in tSNE space and physical space, which confirms their expression within the cluster visualizations prior. Here, I will support the conclusion that cluster 10 is representative of follicular dendritic cells and cluster 6 represents T-lymphocyte-like cells and are supportive that the white pulp tissue structure is represented in the CODEX data. 

Cluster 10 shows the upregulated expression of CD21, HLA.DR, and CD35. Follicular dendritic cells have been demonstrated to express the CD21 isoform as one of its cellular markers (Liu et al, 1997). Dendritic cells expressing HLA.DR are often present in follicular fluid (Fainaru et al., 2011). Lastly, CD35 is a protein that is used to identify follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues and are part of the Splenic CD19-CD35+B220+ cells that function as an inducer of follicular dendritic cell network formation (Murakami et al., 2007). All in all,this supports the conclusion that cluster 10 is representative of the follicular dendritic cell type. 

Cluster 6 shows the upregulation of CD45RO, CD3e, and CD45 most notably. CD45RO is an antigen present on CD4 T-cells that are specific to the memory family (Devi et al., 2017). CD3e is a glycoprotein that is most abundantly found on the surface of T cells (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/916) (CD45 is a marker protein expression on the surface of all T cells and is a crucial component for proper T cell receptor signaling by regulating the activation state of other proteins involved in T cell inactivation (Altin et al., 1997). Furthermore CD45 is often used as the marker for T-cell separation techniques. Thus, I conclude that this cell cluster is representative of the T-cell type. 

Thus, I conclude that I have identified two cell types that are representative of the white pulp tissue structure of the spleen. The white pulp of the spleen is a lymphatic tissue that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It is componed mainly of lymphocytes around arteries. This is supported by the upregulation of T-cell markers in cluster 6 (https://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/lymphoid/lymph_spleen.php#:~:text=White%20pulp%20contains%20lymphoid%20aggregations,helper)%20and%20B%2Dcells.).  Additionally, follicles are arranged at the outer cortex near the capsule of lymph nodes and the outer part of the white pulp (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/follicular-dendritic-cells#:~:text=Follicles%20are%20arranged%20at%20the,of%20the%20tonsils%20and%20PPs.). Specifically, follicular dendritic cells are known to form dense networks in the center of follicles (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/follicular-dendritic-cells#:~:text=Follicles%20are%20arranged%20at%20the,of%20the%20tonsils%20and%20PPs.) Given, that in cluster 10 I identify the upregulation of several markers that are associated with follicular dendritic cells, I conclude that the cluster is representative of this cell type. Given that both clusters identified represent cell types that are characteristic of the cells within the white pulp, I conclude that this tissue structure is represented in the CODEX data.
