### 1. Write a description explaining why you believe your data visualization is effective using vocabulary terms from Lesson 1. 

To identify different spleen tissue structures, I began with K-means clustering. Clustering alone does not indicate which genes drive separation between groups, so I performed differential expression analysis from here. Specifically, I used one-way ANOVA to compare the expresion levels of each gene across all the clusters. This allowed me to create a heatmap of the most relevant genes by expression across the clusters. 

By analyzing the heatmap, I identified CD21 and CD20 as highly expressed in Cluster 2, while CD15 showed strong expression in Cluster 3. These genes were compelling candidates for distinguishing spleen structures because their differential expression patterns indicated that Cluster 2 had a strong B-cell signature, aligning with white pulp, and Cluster 3 contained granulocyte and myeloid markers, consistent with red pulp. To confirm these assignments, I mapped the spatial distribution of these key genes and found that their expression patterns correlated well with the expected locations of these tissue structures in the spleen based 0on the original kmeans clustering. In other words, I could see clearly how high expression of CD20, for instance, had a clear mapping to cluster 2 in the original kmeans depiction.

```r
