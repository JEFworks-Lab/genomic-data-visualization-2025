### 1. Create a data visualization and write a description to convince me that your interpretation is correct. 

#### **Figure Description and Interpretation**

This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, identified through k-means clustering (k = 5), from the CODEX dataset. The analysis includes dimensionality reduction (tSNE and PCA), spatial visualization, and differential expression analysis. The panels are organized into four rows, each providing complementary insights into the clusters' transcriptional and spatial profiles.

**Row 1: Clusters in tSNE and Physical Space**
The first row visualizes Cluster 2 (blue) and Cluster 3 (red) in both tSNE and physical space. In the tSNE plot (Panel A), the two clusters are well-separated from other clusters, indicating distinct expression profiles. The physical space plot (Panel B) reveals that Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 are localized in specific regions of the spleen tissue. Cluster 2 appears to form a network-like structure, while Cluster 3 is more densely packed, suggesting potential functional and spatial differences between the two clusters.

**Row 2: Differential Expression Analysis**
The second row features volcano plots for Cluster 2 (Panel C) and Cluster 3 (Panel D), highlighting differentially expressed genes. In Cluster 2, CD8 is significantly upregulated, while in Cluster 3, CD21 shows significantly high expression. Interestingly, in Cluster 3, CD8 is significantly downregulated, which contrasts sharply with Cluster 2. This difference makes CD8 an excellent representative marker gene for Cluster 2. These markers provide valuable clues about the biological roles of the clusters.

**Row 3: Gene Expression in tSNE Space & Row 4: Gene Expression in Physical Space**
The third row maps the expression of CD8 (Panel E) and CD21 (Panel F) onto the tSNE space. CD8 expression is higher in the top-left region, which aligns with the location of Cluster 2 in Panel A. In contrast, CD21 expression is higher in the bottom-left region, corresponding to the location of Cluster 3 in Panel A.

The fourth row visualizes CD8 (Panel G) and CD21 (Panel H) expression in the physical tissue space. CD8 expression is more concentrated in discrete regions, although the expression is moderate to high expression across nearly all regions. The main distribution, however, still matches that of Cluster 2. On the other hand, CD21 expression is more densely located in the middle, forming a "bean" shape that mirrors the spatial distribution of Cluster 3.

##### **Conclusion**

These patterns further support CD8 and CD21 as strong representative marker genes for Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, respectively. The consistent spatial and expression profiles of these markers reinforce their utility in defining and distinguishing these clusters within the tissue.


#### **Interpretation and Biological Context**

Based on the analysis of Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, the tissue structures represented in the data are consistent with the **white pulp** of the spleen. This interpretation is supported by the spatial distribution of the clusters, the differential expression of key markers, and their alignment with known anatomical features and functions of the spleen’s white pulp.  

Cluster 2 is characterized by the significant upregulation of **CD8**, a marker for cytotoxic T cells, and its network-like spatial distribution. The white pulp contains **periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS)**, which are rich in T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, that play a critical role in adaptive immune responses, including targeting intracellular pathogens and tumor cells (Mebius & Kraal, 2005). The spatial localization of Cluster 2 in discrete, organized regions is consistent with the white pulp, which forms structured immune zones surrounding central arterioles (Steiniger, 2015).

Cluster 3 also belongs to the white pulp but is distinguished by the expression of **CD21, HLA-DR, and ECAD (E-cadherin)**. CD21 is a key marker of **follicular dendritic cells (FDCs)**, which are critical for B-cell activation and the formation of **germinal centers** within the white pulp’s **B-cell follicles** (Suzuki et al., 1995). The presence of **HLA-DR**, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule, further supports this classification, as antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and B cells are abundant in the splenic white pulp (Cesta, 2006). The detection of **E-cadherin (ECAD)** suggests the presence of epithelial-like interactions, possibly linked to stromal components that contribute to follicular structure and organization (Sixt et al., 2004).

The differential expression of markers in these two clusters supports their localization within distinct functional compartments of the **white pulp**. While Cluster 2 aligns with T-cell-rich zones of the **PALS**, Cluster 3 corresponds to the **B-cell follicles** and germinal centers. The spatial separation of these clusters in both tSNE and physical space is consistent with the well-defined compartmentalization of the white pulp (Steiniger, 2015).

##### **Conclusion**

In summary, both Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 represent **distinct immune microenvironments within the splenic white pulp**. Cluster 2, enriched in **CD8+ T cells**, is likely associated with **PALS**, whereas Cluster 3, marked by **CD21+, HLA-DR+, and ECAD+ cells**, corresponds to **B-cell follicles and germinal centers**.
