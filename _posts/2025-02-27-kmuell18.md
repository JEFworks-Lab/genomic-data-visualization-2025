## Identifying White Pulp and Structural Fibroblast Populations in the Spleen

To classify the tissue type in the CODEX dataset, I first applied log transformation and normalization to the protein expression data to ensure comparability across cells. I then performed PCA, followed by t-SNE for visualization. Using k-means clustering, I grouped cells into k=8 distinct clusters and performed differential expression analysis to identify significantly upregulated proteins.

To determine the biological identity of these clusters, I conducted Wilcoxon tests to identify the most significantly upregulated proteins in Clusters 7 and 1. I prioritized those with the smallest p-values to ensure strong statistical support. Cluster 7 exhibited a high expression of CD8, which indicates a predominance of cytotoxic T cells<sup>1</sup>. Cluster 1 showed strong upregulation of SMActin, suggesting a population of smooth muscle cells<sup>2</sup>. I examined them in t-SNE space (plot A) and in tissue space (plot B). Additionally, I mapped CD8 and SMActin to further explore their significance in distinguishing tissue structures.

In Cluster 7, the most significantly upregulated proteins include CD8, Ki67, CD21, and Podoplanin (plot G). CD8 and Ki67 are hallmark markers of active T cells, suggesting that this cluster is rich in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) undergoing proliferation<sup>3</sup>. CD21 is associated with follicular dendritic cells and B-cell zones<sup>4</sup>. These are known to be key components of the white pulp<sup>5</sup>. The presence of Podoplanin, which is involved in stromal-immune crosstalk, further reinforces this classification<sup>6</sup>. These markers strongly indicate that Cluster 7 represents the white pulp, where adaptive immune responses occur.

In contrast, Cluster 1 exhibits high expression of SMActin, Collagen IV, and Podoplanin, all structural proteins associated with mesenchymal and stromal cells (plot H). SMActin (smooth muscle actin) is a marker of contractile fibroblasts, which are abundant in the spleenâ€™s capsule and trabeculae<sup>5,7</sup>. Additionally, Collagen IV is a major structural component of the extracellular matrix of the basement membrane of the spleen<sup>8</sup>. The downregulation of immune-related markers such as CD8, Ki67, and CD45RO suggests that this region is less involved in immune cell activation compared to white pulp. Given the predominance of fibrous structural proteins and the lack of immune activity, Cluster 1 likely corresponds to the capsule or trabeculae, providing mechanical support and structural integrity to the spleen.

To further support these classifications, I examined the expression of a highly upregulated protein from each cluster in both t-SNE space and tissue space. Mapping CD8 and SMActin, which are strongly upregulated in Clusters 7 and 1, respectively, revealed a clear separation: CD8 was highly concentrated in Cluster 7 in t-SNE space (plot C), reinforcing its role in white pulp immune function, whereas SMActin was localized to Cluster 1 (plot E), reinforcing its role in the fibrous support network. This spatial organization aligns with known spleen architecture, where the capsule and trabeculae (plot F) form a protective framework, while the white pulp (plot D) is the primary site of adaptive immune responses<sup>5</sup>.

Interestingly, Podoplanin is upregulated in both Clusters 7 and 1, yet its co-expressed markers differ, highlighting distinct tissue roles. In Cluster 7, Podoplanin appears alongside immune markers (CD8, Ki67), suggesting involvement in lymphoid structure organization. In Cluster 1, it is co-expressed with fibrous structural proteins (SMActin, Collagen IV), reinforcing its role in the capsule or trabeculae<sup>5</sup>. This difference highlights the importance of considering marker co-expression rather than single-marker presence when classifying tissue identity.

Based on these expression patterns and spatial organization, the high presence of CD8+ T cells in Cluster 7 corresponds to the immune-active white pulp. In Cluster 1, the predominance of SMActin-expressing fibroblasts aligns with the structural capsule or trabeculae. These classifications are consistent with known spleen microanatomy.
