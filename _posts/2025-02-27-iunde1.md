### Description 

CD21 and CD35 are highly expressed in the White pulp (2) of the spleen. These markers are typically associated with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and B cells, both of which are predominantly found in the white pulp, particularly within B cell follicles and germinal centers.

To reach this conclusion, I first normalized the data and applied k-means clustering. Upon plotting the spatial distribution of the cells, I observed that cluster 3 exhibited a distinct spatial pattern. To further validate this, I used t-SNE, which preserves local distances and patterns, and confirmed the cluster's spatial arrangement.

Next, I conducted a one-sided Wilcoxon test to identify genes that were significantly upregulated in cluster 3. CD21 and CD35 emerged as the most highly regulated genes. I confirmed their high expression in specific regions through expression plots, supporting the hypothesis that cluster 3 represents the white pulp of the spleen, where B cells and FDCs are most concentrated.

### Code (paste your code in between the ``` symbols)

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

data <- read.csv('genomic-data-visualization-2025/data/codex_spleen_3.csv.gz', row.names = 1)
